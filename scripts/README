README for the loading scripts.

The scripts are:

	* load.sh
		User-callable script that loads everything and produces
		a database dump at the end.

	* load-gotland.sh
		Called by load.sh to load the Gotlandskanin data set.

	* load-mellerud.sh
		Called by load.sh to load the Mellerudskanin data set.


Prerequisites:

	The scripts assumes that in2cvs and csvsql (csvkit via pip) are
	available and that PostgreSQL database drivers (psycopg2 via
	pip) have been installed.


Mode of operation:

	The main load.sh script takes the names of the Gotland and
	Mellerud Excel or CSV files on its command line, as arguments
	to the -g and -m command line options, respectively.  It
	initializes the database (empties it completely by dropping it
	and re-creating it), calls the two genebank-specific scripts,
	and then dumps the resulting database to a date-stamped file.

	The given input files, if they are Excel files, are converted to
	CSV if the corresponding CSV files are missing or if they are
	outdated.

	The two genebank-specific scripts call csvsql to load the CSV
	data into the table called "data" (it drops this table if it
	exists).  Data is then moved from this table into the various
	tables of the main database through a series of INSERT and
	UPDATE statements.

	In the case of the Gotlandskanin data, a separate auxiliary data
	set containing herd data is loaded separately into the table
	"data2" and incorporated from there.  This file must be named as
	the argument to the -G command line option when running the main
	load.sh script.

	The "data" and "data2" tables containing the Excel data are
	never dropped.

	At the end, control is handed back to the main load.sh script
	and it creates a database dump to a file named after the current
	date.  Only the tables that were populated by the scripts are
	dumped.


Typical invocation:

	./load.sh \
	    -g kanindata-gotland-v11.xlxs herd-registry-gotland.xlsx \
	    -m kanindata-mellerud-v5.xlxs
