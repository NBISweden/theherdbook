README for the loading scripts.

The scripts are:

	* load.sh
		User-callable script that loads everything and produces
		a database dump at the end.

	* load-gotland.sh
		Called by load.sh to load the Gotlandskanin data set.

	* load-mellerud.sh
		Called by load.sh to load the Mellerudskanin data set.


Prerequisites:

	The script assumes that csvsql (csvkit via pip) is available and
	that PostgreSQL database drivers (psycopg2 via pip) have been
	installed.


Mode of operation:

	The main load.sh script takes the names of the Gotland and
	Mellerud CSV files on its command line.  It initializes the
	database (empties it completely by dropping it and re-creating
	it), calls the two genebank-specific scripts, and then dumps the
	resulting database to a date-stamped file.

	The two genebank-specific scripts calls csvsql to load the CSV
	data into the table called "data" (it drops this table if it
	exists).  Data is then moved from this table into the various
	tables of the main database through a series of INSERT and
	UPDATE statements.

	In the case of the Gotlandskanin data, a separate auxiliary data
	set containing herd data is loaded separately into the table
	"data2" and incorporated from there.

	The "data" and "data2" tables containing the CSV data are never
	dropped.

	At the end, control is handed back to the main load.sh script
	and it creates a database dump to a file named after the current
	date.  Only the tables that were populated by the scripts are
	dumped.
