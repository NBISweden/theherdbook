README for the loading scripts.

The scripts are:

	* load.sh
		User-callable script that loads everything and produces
		a database dump at the end.

	* load-gotland.sh
		Called by load.sh to load the Gotlandskanin data set.

	* load-mellerud.sh
		Called by load.sh to load the Mellerudskanin data set.


Prerequisites:

	The scripts assumes that in2cvs and csvsql (csvkit via pip) are
	available and that PostgreSQL database drivers (psycopg2 via
	pip) have been installed.

	The scripts will read the two Excel files named on the command
	line (the first one should be the Gotlandskanin file), and
	load-gotland.sh will additionally read extra herd-related data
	from the file herd-registry-gotland.xlsx which needs to be
	present in the current directory.


Mode of operation:

	The main load.sh script takes the names of the Gotland and
	Mellerud Excel files on its command line.  It initializes the
	database (empties it completely by dropping it and re-creating
	it), calls the two genebank-specific scripts, and then dumps the
	resulting database to a date-stamped file.

	The two genebank-specific scripts calls in2csv and csvsql to
	load the Excel data into the table called "data" (it drops this
	table if it exists).  Data is then moved from this table into
	the various tables of the main database through a series of
	INSERT and UPDATE statements.

	In the case of the Gotlandskanin data, a separate auxiliary data
	set containing herd data is loaded separately into the table
	"data2" (from herd-registry-gotland.xlsx) and incorporated from
	there.

	The "data" and "data2" tables containing the Excel data are
	never dropped.

	At the end, control is handed back to the main load.sh script
	and it creates a database dump to a file named after the current
	date.  Only the tables that were populated by the scripts are
	dumped.


Typical invocation:

	./load.sh kanindata-gotland-v11.csv kanindata-mellerud-v5.csv
