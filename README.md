# The Herdbook
The Herd Book Is a NBIS project Supporting the Swedish Board of Agriculture (Jordbruksverket) Action Plan for the Long-term
Sustainable Management of Swedish Animal Genetic Resources 2010–2020.

Mainly measure 5 “Keeping herd books and planning genetic conservation breeding”. Found in https://www2.jordbruksverket.se/webdav/files/SJV/trycksaker/Pdf_rapporter/ra09_15kort.pdf

The aim here is to set up a online web-service for keeping a herd
book and spreading admin task to all local genebank holders.

is no accidental breeding with other races.

breeding/preservation effort for a race.
